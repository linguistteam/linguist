Linguist is a passion project of mine that I've been developing for enjoyment. Crafted using React Native, Expo, and Firebase, it's a mobile application designed to streamline connections between freelance translators and travelers in need of language support native to their destination.

## Run

```bash
yarn install
expo start
```
